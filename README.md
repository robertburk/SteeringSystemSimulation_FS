# SteeringSystemSimulation_FS
This programme simulates the motion of a rack and pinion steering system. It ignores the effects of slip for a more simplified baseline simulation. 

Inputs required: Wheelbase, Trackwidth, distance between kingpins, Rack Length, required rack travel. 
Outputs: Steering arm and tie rod length combinations to achieve a desired minimum turn radius. 

The has 3 potential outcomes.
1. A simulation of your chosen parameters (including steering arm/tie rod lengths) through a specified rack travel range
2. A still frame of your chosen parameters at a specified rack travel value
3. Optimisation mode which returns the length combinations and their corresponding minimum turn radii.
